Description: Dive log program
 Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.
 Subsurface is able to track single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or
 TriMix. It also allows logging of weights and exposure protection used, dive
 masters and dive buddies and enables the user to rate dives and provide
 additional dive notes.
